# Shiny-Econometrics

This repository hosts Shiny applications for my **Econometrics courses**.  
The apps are designed to help students interactively explore econometric concepts such as:

- OLS and standard errors  
- Clustered standard errors and corrections  
- Fixed effects and heterogeneity  
- Instrumental variables (IV) and 2SLS  
- Weak instrument problems  

## How to use

You can run the apps directly in RStudio:

```r
library(shiny)
runApp("path_to_app_folder")
